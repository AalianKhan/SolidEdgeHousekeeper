c This file contains a list of common illegal characters
c for files and directories, and their replacements.
c 
c It covers operating systems such as Windows, Mac and Linux
c and devices such as desktops, tablets and smartphones.
c 
c The format is <illegal character><space><replacement value>
c 
c So for example, '# my_replacement' means 
c If '#' is found, replace it with the text 'my_replacement'.
c Another example, '#' means 
c If '#' is found, replace it with '' (ie, just delete it).
c 
c (Note, in the default mapping below, I replace all illegal
c characters with '~'.  Feel free to change it to your preference.)  
c 
c If you're just using Windows, you probably only have to define
c replacements for the characters    < > : " / \ | ? * !
c and comment out or delete the rest.
c 
c (Actually Windows doesn't care about !, but Solid Edge does.
c It used to identify Assembly Family members.)
c 
c If you mess up, you can delete this file and Housekeeper will
c regenerate it next time you start the program.
c 
c To comment out a line (so Housekeeper ignores it) start the line
c with 'c' as done in this header text.
c 
c There is no error checking when the program reads in this file.
c So don't do stuff like '* ?' or '   c This is too complicated!!!'.
